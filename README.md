# React OMDB

**See Headers Below For Step By Step Outline**

> **Note**: each step has a corresponding commit with the implemented actions on the solution branch of this repo.

### Step 0: Examine the Solution

Fork and clone to get a local copy of the app.


Check out to the ES6 soultion branch.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Spend time playing around with the completed exercise.  Look at `index.js`.  Think about how you would separate your different components and functionality. 

You can also explore the `solution-single-file` branch if you'd like.

A solution with giphy gif searching is available in a [react-giphy-solution](https://github.com/sf-wdi-labs/react-giphy-solution) repo.


### Step 1: Set up a `HelloWorld` Component

Move back to the `master` branch to build out the app yourself! Remove your `node_modules` folder manually, since it's included in `.gitingore`.   Re-`npm install` any packages you will need.

Before we start building our React app, let's create a `HelloWorld` component just to make sure that we've tied everything together properly.  

- In your `/src` directory, configure your `App.js` and `index.js` files to render a `HelloWorld` component.
- Run `npm start` and make sure everything is working.

### Step 2: Add UI for Home

- Rename `App.js` to `Home.js` to better indicate the purpose of the file. Make sure to update references to this file elsewhere in your application accordingly.
- Create a Home component that returns a container `<div>` element, which should in turn contain a `<h1>` element.
- Render that component to the DOM in your app's main `index.js` file

### Step 3: Add UI for Search

- Create a new file for your `Search` component.
- Define a `Search` component that renders a search form. This can be a simple form with a single input and submit button.
- Import the `Search` file to your `Home` file.
- Render the `Search` component in the `Home` component.

### Step 4: Wire up the Search Button

- Define your `Search` component's initial state. It should have a `query` value that corresponds to a search term.
- Define a function that is triggered whenever the user submits the Search form. Start by just logging `"searched!"` to make sure it works.
  - Use an event listener to attach this function to your form. Try googling `onSubmit`.
- Define a function that updates your `query` value in state whenever a change is made to the input field. Try googling `onChange`.  
- Update your submit function so that it now logs the `query` value in state.

### Step 5: Move search logic to a `SearchContainer` component

- Create a new `SearchContainer` component that that renders the `Search` component. This `SearchContainer` will also handle search results. 
- Refactor your `Search` component so that it only renders a UI. It should use properties passed into the Search component.
- Move all of the business logic related to state for the search into the `SearchContainer` component. The `SearchContainer` component should still render the `Search` component, with any necessary properties.

### Step 6: When a User Searches...

- Define a `Results` component that will take in a collection of ~~movie~~ gif objects and render each one's ~~movie's title and poster~~ `source` url as well as a fixed height image.  Go ahead an look at the ~~[OMDB API documentation](http://omdbapi.com/)~~ [Giphy search documentation](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint) to see the structure of the JSON it sends.
- Update your `SearchContainer` component's state to include whether the user has submitted a search.
- Update `SearchContainer`'s state to include a list of results.
- If a user has searched, instead of rendering the `Search` component, render a `Results` component with hard coded data.
- This is starting to look like a single page app, but we don't have routing yet. If you'd like, update the component so that the search bar and any results are always displayed on the page, and clear out old results when a new search is submitted.

### Step 7: Search the ~~Omdb~~ Giphy API

- With the API we're using, you don't need to register for an API key. Go ahead an look at the ~~[OMDB API documentation](http://omdbapi.com/)~~ [documentation](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI) to determine the API's proper usage.
- We're going to be searching the ~~movie~~ giphy API based on ~~title~~ a word or phrase to return a collection of results.
- Load in jQuery, and use it to make an HTTP request to the API search endpoint using the user's query.
- Pass the movie data to the Results component to be displayed.

### Step 8: Add Styles to your React app

- Load in Bootstrap CDN in `index.html`.
- Modify UI to include Bootstrap classes.
- Create a `styles` directory and make a file for your CSS rule definitions - this will be written in Javascript!.
- Load in that file in any component and then use that to apply inline styling.

### Step 9: Add a single result detail component

- Create a `Details` component that renders information about a single ~~movie~~ gif.
- When a user clicks on a ~~movie~~ gif in the results view, render the ~~movie~~ detail UI.
